    <td>The culinary art of the food truck vendor has been steadily
    improving over the last 10 years with fine offerings from
    Antonio's Italian, Organic on the Road, and now Curbside Thai.
    Sajja Adulet is to be congratulated for offering delicious
    and authentic Thai food at a reasonable price. We think
    Curbside Thai provides the finest Asian food on or off
    the streets of Charlotte.<br>

    <td>Steaming rice with a spicy Asian sauce is common street fare
    and we all accept its limitations in exchange for the
    convenience of a quick bite on the run. With Curbside Thai you
    don't have to compromise. Building on his experience as a
    master chef at several fine establishments on the East Coast,
    Sajja Adulet has brought the taste of fine dining to the
    Food Cart Wars and we couldn't be happier.<br>
